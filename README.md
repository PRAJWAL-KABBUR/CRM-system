# CRM-system

In the project I created modules like leads, where we gather information of the customer name,
phone no. email addresses etc. It helps you focus on your organization's relationships with
individual people including customers, service users, colleagues, or suppliers throughout your
lifecycle with them, including finding new customers, winning their business, and providing
support and additional services throughout the relationship. Especially Sales and marketing teams
rely on CRM to create collaboration and improve their productivity.
